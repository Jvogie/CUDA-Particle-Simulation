# CUDA Particle Simulation

This project demonstrates a simple particle simulation using CUDA, showcasing the parallel processing capabilities of GPUs for simulating particle movement. Each particle is updated based on its velocity, and the final positions are saved to a text file. Additionally, a Python script is provided to visualize the final particle positions.
